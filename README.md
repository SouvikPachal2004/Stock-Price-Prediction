  # 📈 Stock Price Prediction Web App

  Welcome to the **Stock Price Prediction Web App**, a web-based application designed to forecast future stock prices using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks**. This project combines a **Flask backend**, **machine learning**, and a **modern interactive frontend** to provide an intuitive experience for users interested in stock market predictions. 🚀

  ## ✨ Features
  - 🧠 **LSTM-Based Prediction**: Uses historical stock market data to predict future prices with high accuracy.
  - 📊 **Interactive Visualization**: View predicted vs actual stock prices using dynamic charts powered by **Chart.js**.
  - 💻 **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily select stock tickers and date ranges, making stock prediction accessible even for beginners.
  - 🔗 **RESTful Backend API**: Flask serves the prediction model and provides API endpoints for frontend interaction.
  - 🗄️ **Data Handling**: Automatically fetches historical stock data for the selected ticker and processes it for LSTM training.
  - ⚡ **Lightweight and Fast**: Minimalistic frontend and efficient backend to ensure fast predictions and smooth visualization.
  - 🧪 **Scalable ML Architecture**: LSTM model can be retrained or improved with more data for better accuracy.

  ## 📋 Installation Guide

  Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

  1. **Clone the repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SouvikPachal2004/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
  cd stock-price-predictor/backend
🚀 Usage Instructions

Enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT) in the input field.

Select the desired date range for prediction.

Click Predict to visualize:

The predicted stock prices by the LSTM model.

The actual historical prices for comparison.

Charts update dynamically, allowing zooming and hovering for detailed information.

🔹 Note: The first prediction may take a few seconds as the model processes the historical data.

🧩 How It Works

Data Fetching: The data_fetcher.py script collects historical stock prices.

Data Preprocessing: Data is normalized and converted into sequences suitable for LSTM input.

LSTM Model: The lstm_model.py defines a deep LSTM neural network trained on historical sequences.

Prediction: Model predicts future stock prices for the selected period.

Visualization: Predicted and actual values are sent to the frontend and displayed via Chart.js.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3 🐍

Flask ⚡ (Backend server and API)

TensorFlow / Keras 🧠 (LSTM neural network for predictions)

HTML / CSS / JavaScript 💻 (Frontend interface)

Chart.js 📊 (Dynamic interactive charts)

Pandas & NumPy 🐼🔢 (Data manipulation and numerical operations)

📌 Notes & Best Practices

Make sure the virtual environment (backend/venv) is excluded via .gitignore.

The LSTM model training may take a few seconds to minutes depending on the size of historical data.

For production deployment, consider using Gunicorn or uWSGI instead of the Flask development server.

You can retrain the model with updated stock data for better accuracy over time.

Avoid committing large datasets or virtual environments to GitHub; keep .gitignore properly configured.

🏗️ Future Enhancements

📈 Real-Time Stock Data Integration: Automatically fetch live stock prices for real-time prediction.

📱 Responsive Frontend: Make the UI mobile-friendly for better accessibility.

🔮 Multiple ML Models: Compare LSTM predictions with ARIMA or Prophet models for improved performance.

📊 Advanced Visualization: Add candlestick charts and volume analysis.

💾 Database Integration: Store historical and predicted data for analytics and historical comparisons.
